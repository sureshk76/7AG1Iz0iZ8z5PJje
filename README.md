The stock market forecasting was performed using the following models:
1.  ARIMA/SARIMA
2.  Simple Exponential Smoothing
3.  Prophet
4.  LSTM

The auto_arima was used to find out the best model fit for the data and it was found that ARIMA(2, 1, 0) was the one most suitable.  The predictions were as expected for such traditional models.
The simple exponential smoothing model did not perform well.
The Prophet model performed reasonably well showing predictions that could be useful.
The LSTM model as well preformed reasonably well with some useful predictions
